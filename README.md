# Current Plan
The basic idea for this plugin is to have a neutral position inside Zellij. I'm
not interested in immense detail, but rather something like the dashboard in 
doom emacs. Some features would be:
- Date & Time
- Calendar Integration? (idk how to get this working, but i'd like it to work with macOS)
- Zellij Tab View (+ keybindings)
- Simple keybindings:
  - T for terminal (or terminal tab)
  - J for julia repl (or julia repl tab)
  - E for editor (or editor tab)
  - S for script dir?
  - U for updates (brew, rustup, npm, julia, etc.)
  - and more, that should probably be customizable. These are just good defaults.
- Results of previous commands (U/T/J)
- Theming sync with Zellij
